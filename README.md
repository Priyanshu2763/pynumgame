Project Title: Number Guessing Game

Description: For my first-year project, I developed a simple yet engaging number guessing game using Python. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. With each guess, the game provides feedback, guiding the player closer to the correct answer. This project not only reinforced my understanding of Python programming but also helped me practice using conditional statements, loops, and random number generation. It was a great way to get hands-on experience with coding logic and user interaction.

Key Features:

Random number generation for unpredictability.
Input validation to ensure players enter valid numbers.
Feedback mechanism to inform players if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
A counter to track the number of guesses taken.
This project was a great introduction to programming and sparked my interest in developing interactive applications.
